            Genetic Algorithm or for short GA is a search based 
            optimization technique based on the principle and concept 
            of Genetic evolution and Natural Selection. In more simple 
            words it's similar to survival of the fittest. Where in a 
            given population only those individuals are selected that 
            are best suited for a particular task.

            This small project was build using a small custom 
            implementation of Neural Network along with P5js and Bootstrap. 
            The same can be replicated using tensorflow.js.

            The main reason behind using custom implementation of 
            Neural Network was that it is more light weight and can be 
            easily tweaked further for a specific problem.

                    This is a popular classic game, where we have 
                    to make sure our little bird friend is able to avoid the 
                    maximum amount of pipes it can. Therefor an ideal bird 
                    would be the one which is able to slowly evolve in a 
                    manner that allows it to avoid those pipes. In this 
                    example we create a virtual environment and we extract 
                    valuable features from the environment on which the birds 
                    evolve on through successive generation.
